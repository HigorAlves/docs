# Prepare Release

- Determine next version of release `vX.X.X` (look at previous version number and increment appropriately)
- Add any custom release steps to the release page that are necessary beyond the below instructions

# Releasing the application

These instructions cover how to release the web app and the backend services. The web app and backend are part of the same repo so they are released together

### Preparing the Release

1. On local machine, ensure you have no tracked or untracked changes, then create the release branch:

> ℹ️ There are two kinds of releases. Normal releases and hotfix releases. Follow the correct section below for the steps on each.

#### **Normal Release**

Prepare a normal release by running the below command.

 ```bash
 yarn release major || minor || patch
```

> ℹ️ `yarn release-prepare X.X.X` will create the new release branch from the latest `dev`, bump the `package.json` versions and push the release branch to the GitLab repository.

> NOTE: It will not create the tag at this time. That's done later in the release process when the release has been tested and approved.

#### **Hotfix Release**

If your release is for a specific bug on production that needs an immediate patch, you will base your branch off of an existing release tag.

 ```bash
 yarn release:hotfix major || minor || patch
```

>	ℹ️ `yarn release:hotfix major || minor || patch` will create a new release branch from the given `source release tag` , bump the `package.json` and `lerna.json` version and push the release branch to the bubbles Github repository

>	NOTE: The key here is that you are not branching off dev, which could have changes not yet ready for production, instead you’re creating a new branch from a previous tag. Also, the new release tag will not be created at this time.

2. Open a PR from `release/vX.X.X` → `master`
 - Name PR `Release vX.X.X`
 - PR should remain in draft mode and no reviewers should be assigned
 - PR should not be merged until QA has passed and Product & Design have given their approval

### Testing the Release

Any fixes that come out of testing the release will have PRs opened against `release/vX.X.X`.

### Final Sanity Check

CI will check code before deployment, but it's always good to do a final sanity check before deploying to production.

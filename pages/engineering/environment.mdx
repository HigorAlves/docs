# Mac OS with M1

## Basics

After you have a fresh new install from the latest Mac OS you need to install some basically tools to be able to configure the entire environment.

Lets start with the `XCode` command lines by running the command inside your terminal this will install the `clang` `gcc` `git` .

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Now we need to install a very useful tool named `brew` this will help us to install external packages and programs.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Terminal

We use `ZSH` as our terminal with `Power Level 10K` as the style guide, for the fonts you can use the `Nerd Fonts`

```bash
brew install zsh
```

After the `ZSH` installation succeed you will be able to install the `Power level 10k` the easiest way is following their tutorial, there you can find even which font to use

## Docker

Install with brew

```bash
brew install docker
```

## Node JS

To be able to change and install multiple NodeJS versions you need a tool named NVM (Node Version Manager)

```bash
brew install nvm
```

After that you need to tell your terminal, in our case `zsh` that we have the `nvm` location for that you need to add this code inside your `~/.zshrc`

```bash
# NVM Brew config
export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
```

### Python

Install `pyenv` using brew command

```bash
brew install pyenv
```

Add the variables into bash

```bash
# PyEnv config
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

Then install and install python version `2.7.18` with

```bash
pyenv global 2.7.18
```
